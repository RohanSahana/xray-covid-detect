# xray-covid-detect

## Background: 
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) constitutes a public health emergency globally. The number of infected people and deaths are proliferating every day, which is putting tremendous pressure on our social and healthcare system. Rapid detection of COVID-19 cases is a significant step to fight against this virus as well as release pressure off the healthcare system.

## Objective: 
One of the critical factors behind the rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic is a lengthy clinical testing time. The imaging tool, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), can speed up the identification process. Therefore, our objective is to develop an automated CAD system for the detection of COVID-19 samples from healthy and pneumonia cases using CXR images.

## Methods: 
Due to the scarcity of the COVID-19 benchmark dataset, we have used deep learning techniques, where we have created CNN model from scratch.

## Conclusion: 
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for the identification of COVID-19 cases using CXR images.
